# cns-business-hours
A simple microservice stub for answering the business hours global problem. (;

It is based on a stabe and covered version of http://search.cpan.org/~pryan/Period-1.20/Period.pm 
Basically this is a great generic microservice candidate for a problem that has been solved in a proprietary(or not?) fashion in many ITSM/CRM/ERP implementations, but I am leaving it here for my own convenience as I am facing this type of requirements whereever I go. (:
The project is based on the Spring hateoas archetype: https://projects.spring.io/spring-hateoas/
Which is based on the Richardson REST maturity model: https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html
